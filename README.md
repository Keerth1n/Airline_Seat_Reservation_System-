Airline Seat Reservation System
Airline Seat Reservation System is based on the concept of reserving airline seats for the
passengers.
Here the user has to select the seat class whether to choose Business or Economy class.
Then the system displays available seats, and the user has to enter that particular seat
number in order to reserve it and has to enter their details like name, age, phone
number, Departure city, arrival city and journey dates. After reserving a seat, that
particular seat wonâ€™t be available anymore for other users.
